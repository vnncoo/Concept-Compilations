# Concept-Compilations
Web/App Ideas, and Concepts I want to build.

//THIS REPOSITORY IS A COMPILATION OF IDEAS I HAVE / HAD / ABANDONED

The point of this repository is to demonstrate my creativity in not only solving problems, but to also bringing new ideas to life.

I also made this repository to keep track of great ideas and concepts I can use later on (My memory has like 50 bytes of storage).

Anybody interested in working with any of the ideas in this repository is free to do so. If you're also interested in working on it with me
Contact me: (vnncoo@gmail.com)
