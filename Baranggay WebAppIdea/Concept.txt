The Idea is to make an App/Site for Baranggays and Municipalities to further digitalize most of their processes

The functions I'm planning to implement:

0 (REGISTRATION)
  0.1) -This is ofcourse a given, to avoid fake Scheduling and increase security in the app.
       -Users will be required to choose their Municipality so that they get the correct information they need in the app

1) Scheduling
   1.1) -I'm thinking of a function that allows users to check available dates for geting certain papers.
       They will be able to schedule their visit depending on the vacant time and slot for the specific date.

   1.1 - Possible issues)
      -If the 1.1 was to be implemented, it might cause problems because if we are to implement that function,
      we'll have to determine how to get the vacant time. It will require lots of data and it can fluctuate.
      Choosing it might lead to inaccuracy.
      
   1.2) -I'm thinking we can just put the amount of people that scheduled for a specific task in a specific date.
       This will allow the people planning to schedule to see whether the date they chose is already flooded or not.

2) Announcements
   1.1) -I'm thinking of a function that gives announcements to a user based on their Municipality.
       Basically a function where users can get relevant news/updates/announcements about the areas that they selected

3) Job Postings
  1.1) A job posting for job vacancies in the specific area the user is residing in.
