The Idea is to make an App/Site for Baranggays and Municipalities to further digitalize most of their processes

The functions I'm planning to implement:

1) Scheduling
  1.1) -I'm thinking of a function that allows users to check available dates for geting certain papers.
  They will be able to schedule their visit depending on the vacant time and slot for the specific date.

  1.1 - Possible issues)
    -If the 1.1 was to be implemented, it might cause problems because if we are to implement that function,
    we'll have to determine how to get the vacant time. It will require lots of data and it can fluctuate.
    Choosing it might lead to inaccuracy.
